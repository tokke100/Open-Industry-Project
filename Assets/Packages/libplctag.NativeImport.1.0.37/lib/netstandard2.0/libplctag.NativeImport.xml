            <summary>
            The library provides debugging output when enabled.
            There are three ways to set the debug level (for historical reasons):
            <list type="number">
                <item>Adding a debug attribute to the attribute string when creating a tag: "protocol=XXX&amp;...&amp;debug=4".</item>
                <item>Using the <see cref="M:libplctag.NativeImport.plctag.plc_tag_set_int_attribute(System.Int32,System.String,System.Int32)"/>function to set the debug attribute.</item>
                <item>Using the <see cref="M:libplctag.NativeImport.plctag.plc_tag_set_debug_level(System.Int32)"/> function.</item>
            </list>
            The preferred method in code is the last one.

            The library provides functions to register a callback on a tag.
            These events generate a call to that callback.

            It is not safe to call any API functions on the tag at this time.
            This is purely for the callback to manage any application state.

            This is not as well supported in some cases, so only depend on this for normal tags and not tags like @tags.

            This class provides low-level (raw) access to the native libplctag library (which is written in C).
            The purpose of this package is to expose the API for this native library, and handle platform and configuration issues.

            <summary>
            During initialization, this package extracts to disk the appropriate native library.
            By default, it will overwrite files with the same filename (plctag.dll, libplctag.so, or libplctag.dylib).
            If you wish to disable this behaviour and use a different native library (e.g. one that you've compiled yourself, or a pre-release), you can disable the Force Extract feature by setting this value to false.
